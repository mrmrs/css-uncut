# CSS UNCUT

## What is this?

1. An experiment.
2. The answer to a question I started to ask after noticing websites serve up 200kb - 1MB+ css files.

## The Question

> "How big is the entire css language? Is it bigger or smaller than 500K?"

So, what is css uncut? It is an attempt to put the entire css language in one file.
For the most part it's a bunch of single purpose classes name spaced to three different breakpoints.

Plus a few other things like a clearfix solution for good measure.

## The Answer

The file sizes:

```
npm install --save-dev css-uncut
```
```
 480K - i.css        (uncompresed)
 390K - i.min.css    (minified)
  47K - i.min.css.gz (minified & gzipped)
```

47K minified and gzipped. This gives in an interesting baseline to compare 500K+ css files to.
It should be noted that gzip loves single purpose classes as it's compression algorithm
works best when common words are close together.
If you randomize the order of class declaration in i.css,
it minifies and gzips down to *54K* which turns out to be a delta of about 7K.

#### Note documentation is work in progress

## So what do you mean 'all' of css

Some things would be almost impossible to represent in totality. Like gradient combinations for instance.
But most things are pretty easy. Properties such as float, display, list-style-type, overflow etc.
have a fairly small set of values. This has all of those things. Four times.

Some things are a bit trickier though. How many different border-widths should be included? What about
border-colors? I tried to err on the side of being more verbose than I thought any feasible ui would need.
In this case I chose to include 140 different border colors for congruency with the provided skin classes.

If it's in the spec, it's probably in here. If you notice anything missing. Please open an issue or file a pull
request.

### Dimensions

For each of the dimension properties i.e
```
width, max-width, min-width, height, max-height, min-height
```
There are classes for:
* A ten point rem scale based off powers of two
* Each percentage value (0-100%);
* Each keyword option i.e max-content, min-content, fit-content, fill-available.

### Colors

Skin classes for each of the 140 color names defined in the css/html spec.

### Spacing

Eight step scale for both margins and padding.
Single purpose classes to target: all, top, right, bottom, and left sides as well
as utilities to space horizontally  and vertically. It's easy to extend if you need more or less
steps.

## What needs work

Naming conventions. There are some nice grockable consistent patterns, but some of them aren't that
well thought out to be honest. Particularly things like flexbox, animation, and transitions.

Selector count. I wouldn't advise dropping this into your next project in totality.
There are more than 4096 selectors and that means certain versions of ie won't parse
the whole style sheet. If you want to drop the selector count though you can use something like un-css
to clean up any unused classes.

Documentation. Definitely needs more documentation.

## Big styles

How much css do websites serve up to users?

```
ESPN          322K
Kickstarter   844K
Salesforce    1.02M
Macaw         593K
Adobe         503K
Apple Store   440K
```
